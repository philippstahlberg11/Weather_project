# WEATHER_APPLICATION

WE wish to make a smarter weather-application, that can most importantly tell guidence to the user about not only possibly extreme weather conditions, but also warning that there is a high percentage of rain at 17:00 and that one should bring a umberalla with him, also things like warning for pollen and people who have allergies like it.
(shows with some text, kind of like a tip of the day princible, but much more useful for your day-to-day basis)

Requ.
-Temperature
-Current weather cast (overcast, sunny, rain, thunder)
-Visualizations for CWC(Current weather cast)
-Graph - Showing temperature troughout the day, CWC and visualizations for this(could be a cloud...), timestamps,
line in graph showing the temperatur (for better knowing the drops and the average temperature), perhaps average line temperature? in filters..
-Humidity
-Wind
- Weather "widgets" for the next days - these should include minimal (but highly important information) about the weather in the upcoming days (how many? - see the API, and how far it actually reaches with high percentages of "truth")

ADD-ONS:
- Chances of rain/thunder and so on, e.g. 70% for rain...
- Feels like temperature vs air temperature (adding the feels like...)
- Wind direction
- Wind map, visualizing what direction the wind is going how strong and so on, inspiration from Windy.com
- Sun-rise/-set, showing what time they will be, perhaps also a visualization like a half ring, visualizating how "far" it has come to the it's so called phase of being up, and then slowly moving towards sunset.
- UV 
- Sight, how far could one see currently
- Pressure 
- Pollen
- Sounds for the corresponding weather (rainy sound for rain, peacefullness for sunny etc.)


Bigger ADD-ONS (if possible):
- All the chances of things to happen in a widget, this including thunder/rain/sun and so on...
- Mone-phases, showing what moon phase it currently is, and will be in the next couple of days...
- More user interaction e.g. can write a temperature and it will say when the location will reach this temperature...
- Tips for what clothings to wear for the corresponding weather, and other tips (maybe bus routes if there is a high likelyhood for rain or even a tip for a raincoat/umberall since there most likely will be rain...)
- Drought warning, for people who are interested in agriculture and so on
- "The same day in 1985, the temperature was twenty degress lower"- random facts like these can make us stand out!
- Warnings for thunder, but most importantly earthquakes and extreme weather... - could also include things like pollen! 
- Pictures of the corresponding area, meaning the specific mountains/areas
- Percentage for power-outages (most likely corresponding to earthquakes, or powerfull rain/thunder) tips for people in the oil/gass industry
- Perhaps somehow get to know the user more, that we give of tips that are powerful for ones user, clothing, road conditions (if not on the road, what should we transport by), back again home, and mountaing climbing and so on, possibilities are endless here... 
- Location based weather
- UV weather map
